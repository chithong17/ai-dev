# COBOL-AIRLINES Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accurate Translation of Business Logic
All business logic from COBOL must be accurately translated to Java, ensuring functional parity and adherence to original requirements.

### II. Data Integrity and Business Rules
Data integrity must be preserved across all operations. Business rules must be implemented consistently and validated rigorously.

### III. Modern React UI
The user interface must be developed using React, closely resembling the original COBOL interface while incorporating modern design principles.

### IV. Testing Standards
Each module must have at least three automated test cases to ensure functionality, reliability, and maintainability.

### V. Deployability
The system must support deployment via Docker containers or localhost setups, ensuring ease of deployment and testing.

## Additional Constraints

### Technology Stack Requirements
- COBOL for legacy systems.
- Java for modernized backend logic.
- React for frontend development.
- Docker for containerized deployment.

## Governance

- Amendments to this constitution require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
- Compliance with principles must be verified during code reviews.
- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for new principles, PATCH for clarifications.
